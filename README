Version 1.0

This is the preliminary proof-of-concept I slapped together for a PHP-based Point Of Sale system, with inventory management.

This version uses XML for both inventory and sales records and MySQL for username/password processing. Depending on the application, it can easliy be modified to use MySQL for everything but I found it simpler here to process (plaintext) XML files - there are also log files which are updated when a user logs in, logs out, interacts with the inventory, or makes a sale - basically everything is logged and timestamped...

You need to pay close attention to the file permissions on those logs, for (hopefully obvious) security reasons.

Most of this code was revised into a much more OO version for deployment, allowing for someone else to come in and easily make modifications, as required. I uploaded this version as a starting base, for anyone else interested in developing such a system. I'm sure I have a copy of the OO version somewhere - once I find it I will push out an update organised into a nice MVC (Zend) framework.
